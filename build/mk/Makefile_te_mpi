# SUFFIX RULE : This is an assignment ie .SUFFIXES has target .f90 
# The suffix rule will look only for files with .f90 suffix
# corresponding the filename.o
# The .SUFFIXES tells make to look at the corresponding file name with .f90 suffix e.g
# Make will look at file1.o and then snatch file1.f90 and compile file1.f90 if file1.f90 is newer than
# file1.o

.SUFFIXES:	.f90         

# INFERENCE RULE FOR COMPILATION ::
# This inference rule tells make to look for that file ending with the 1st suffix which is needed
# to make files ending with .o
# This Inference rule is executing a command so the action  to be done is tabbed over 
# on the next line
